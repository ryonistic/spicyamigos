<p>SpicyAmigos is a restaurant website for ordering food or booking table reservations.</p>
<strong>These are sample pieces of code for my portfolio. </strong>
<p>The site has been built with NextJs as the frontend and Django Rest Framework is being deployed at the back in order to open API endpoints to CRUD information via the frontend.</p>
<p>The database management system I used in this case was Postgresql.</p>
<p>Though, the DBMS related entries are not included in the git files, the settings are still pushed so one can see what I used on the local development server.</p>
