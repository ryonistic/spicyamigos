<p>Restaurant website for ordering food or booking table reservations.</p>
<strong>This is a sample piece of code for my portfolio. </strong>
<p>The site has been built with NextJs as the frontend and Django Rest Framework is being deployed at the back in order to send the info to the frontend.</p>
<p>The database management system deployed is Postgresql.</p>
<p>Though, that is not included in the git version, the settings are still pushed so one can see what I used on the local development server.</p>
