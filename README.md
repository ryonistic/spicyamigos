Restaurant website for ordering food or booking table reservations. This is a sample piece of code for my portfolio.
The home page shows the navbar, some nice and clean CSS built with Tailwind and a list of menu items. The banner image is fetched directly but the items are fetched from the backend web api provided by DRF.

Items are being fetched from an API endpoint provided by the Django Rest Framework. All items are being displayed from the backend in static render.
